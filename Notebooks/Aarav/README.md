9/18/24:
- Met with Gregg in the machine shop. 

9/25/24:
- checked Github notebooks

- opinions on the proposal
  - improve the introduction by describing the background of battle bots and the competition
  - label the visual aid
  - label data transmission lines in the block diagram
  - add voltage value to the voltage regulator in the block diagram
  - include the use of the PWM with the motors
  - requirements need hard metrics. Under each subsystem requirement, what should it satisfy to know that it's working

- discussed design document

9/30/24:
- Submitted the design document. Discussed proposal regrade.

10/8/24:
- Attended the design review. Got suggestions on ESCs. Also talked about how we will be implementing our blade. Should it be
  in the middle of the bot or the top? We talked a little about things on our PCB but this is still quite uncertain. 

10/16/24:
- Submitted our PCB design for the first iteration. There may be potential issues with the resistors/capacitors we are using.
- Reminder to submit the team evaluation form due today.
- Already met with machine shop people so that's nice.

10/23/24:
- Submitted our second round of PCB orders after modifying the first one. But it turns out the first one is too small.
- Going to work on a better, larger design (10x10cm) to be able to solder for our third-week order.

10/30/24:
- Design document suggestions/missing things:
  - Lost 2 points for PCB schematic
  - Missing citations
  - Everything else looks good
 
11/4/24:
- Met over Zoom today, which was nice
- Submitted our new board today, let's see how it goes.
- Reminder for the individual progress report due today.
- Also a reminder for the design doc that needs to be updated and submitted by the day after tomorrow.
